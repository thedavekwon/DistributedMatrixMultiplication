# Multi Node Threaded Matrix Multiplication
We extend from the single node threaded matrix multiplication. We have a coordinator that has Matrix A and Matrix B that it wants to compute. For the initial rev, we assume fault-free. Coordinator splits the task into 8 jobs and stores them into a queue. Worker node knows the hostname and port of the coordinator and requests matrices to compute from coordinator. Coordinator then sends the matrices and the split information that the worker should compute back to worker. The worker acts as a single node multi threaded matrix multiplication and sends back the result to coordinator. When coordinator receives all 8 results back, it adds them and receive the final matrix.
